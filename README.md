# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I can implement user needs into a program by creating user stories and then developing test cases based on the user stories. The user stories tell me what features the user wants and what the functionality of the features should be. I can then create test cases that are pass/fail that support these stories. The feature is not complete until it fully passes all test cases.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I can approach developing programs by first focusing on what the project needs to do to be successful. Setting guidelines for success and identifying potential risk factors will help me with development and timeboxing features. I hope to apply more agile estimation practices in my future work. I find I can underestimate the amount of time and work needed to finish a certain task and learning good estimation skills will benefit me and my future development work.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe being a good team member means understanding how to communicate effectively with your team members. All team members should be shown respect and given a safe space to share their issues with the project and ask for help. Being a good team member also means not withholding important information. Learning to ask for help is an important tool and not something to feel ashamed of.
